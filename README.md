SQL/Postgres using IPL Project
----------------------------------------
- Write code that parses CSV and stores matches and deliveries related data in a normalized form in database.
- Learn about one to one, one to many, many to one and many to many relationships
- Identity one-to-one, one to many, many to one and many to many relationships in the matches data and deliveries data.
- Think about the number tables you would need and how to design them.
- Once the script is made to parse matches.csv and deliveries.csv data into database, solve the same questions again, however this time using Postgres data.
